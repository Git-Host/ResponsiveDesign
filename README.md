## First step

With this project, you can work directly online with some **cloud service**, or on **localhost**, as you wish.

In order to use these services, you need to sign up on:

- [Cloud9](https://c9.io/) (**optional**) you can signing with your GitHub / Bitbucket account if you have one, your project will be accessible from your dashboard then

**GitHub** will be our online versionned working copy

and

**Cloud9** will be our working station (node virtual machine, working IDE, testing server, etc...)

or

**localhost / bash** hmmm i like black screen :)


When you have created your account, if you want try Cloud9, please go to your Cloud9 dashboard, and create a new workspace, then start editing it.

# Clone and build the project

First, you need to fork the project from the original repository. Click on the *Fork* button on the top right corner of main project page.

Ok it's done, you can now build the project and start to work !
